# Setting up development environment

First, install [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/en/download.html)

Configure the server to point to the src folder.

Open phpMyAdmin and create a new database with a password.

Import the `db.sql` file from the root of the repository.

Create an `.env` file on the parent directory of `/src` from the `.env.sample` file, change the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_HOST`, and `DB_PASSWORD` values to the corresponding values of your database and start the server (apache and mySql)

The database sample contains two users: `skwal` and `john` with the password `password`.

Don't forget to import the new `db.sql` file every time you `git fetch` or `git pull`.
