# The User class ðŸ‘¤

The `User` class contains useful methods for working with users.

First create your user like this:

```php
$user = new User("skwal", "username");
```

- `skwal` : Identification of the user (his username, id, email...)
- `username` : The identification type (username, id, email...)

Then you can use the following methods and properties:

```php
