# Skwal.net contributor guide 🧑‍💻

The Skwal.net website is only maintained by one person.

It is very slow to add new features, fix bugs 🐛 etc.

This is why we highly appreciate any contribution to the project 👍

Every contributor will receive a **contributor badge** ✨ and will be credited

This module contains instructions for contributing to skwal.net, see **sections 📄**
