# Wiki

If you want to contribute to skwal.net, you first need to understand the structure of the website.

There are a lot of informations about that in the [wiki](https://github.com/SkwalExe/skwal.net/wiki).

# Setting up development environment

For this project, I recommend Visual Studio Code.

Warning : You should **only** open the `üìÇ src/` folder if you want to edit the source code *of the website* (not the source code of the project, readme etc) 

You'll need to install the php server extension

```
ext install brapifra.phpserver
```

and click on the php icon in the top right corner of the editor to start a local server.
