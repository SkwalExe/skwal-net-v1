If you unfortunately do not respect the rules of our website, in order to protect our users, we will apply some sanctions 🚨.

Sanctions may vary depending on the seriousness of the fault, on each page of our terms, you will find the sanctions corresponding to each case.

Please be aware that if we consider you to be harmful to our users, we can take sanctions even if you have not explicitly violated any rules of the site. 

The moderators 👮 responsible for enforcing the rules of the site are, like everyone else, humans who can make mistakes. This is why, if you think that a sanction is not justified, we allow you to contact us by [email ✉️](mailto:support@skwal.net) in order to explain to us what you think.
